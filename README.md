# Clarity Compass

## A Cognitive Intelligence System for Adaptive Self-Optimization

Clarity Compass observes behavioral signals, models cognitive load, predicts instability, and evolves with your cognitive rhythm.

It is not a productivity tracker; it is a cognitive modeling engine.



## Core Concept

Clarity Compass translates daily behavioral inputs into:

* Load trajectories
* Stability probabilities
* Burnout risk forecasts
* Behavioral archetype detection
* Growth evolution tracking



Clarity Compass
A Cognitive Intelligence System for Adaptive Self-Optimization

Clarity Compass is a living cognitive intelligence platform that observes behavioral signals, models cognitive load, predicts instability, and evolves alongside the user’s mental rhythm.


It is not a productivity tracker.
It is a cognitive modeling engine.

* **React 18 + TypeScript**
* **Vite**
* **Tailwind CSS**
* **shadcn/ui**
* **Framer Motion**
* **Recharts**
* **Spline (3D rendering)**
* Optional **local LLM integration (Ollama)**



## Key Features

* **Cognitive Arc**: Daily system state → question → resolution
* **Load & Stability Modeling**: Real-time cognitive load computation
* **Risk Forecasting**: Burnout, instability, and recovery deficit probabilities
* **Cognitive DNA**: Reactivity index, sleep sensitivity, cognitive age
* **Archetype Detection**: Behavioral signature identification
* **Simulation Lab**: Project future cognitive load trajectories
* **Cognitive Coach**: Algorithmic + optional local LLM intelligence
* **Evolution Engine**: Five-level growth tracking
* **Correlation Matrix**: Cross-factor behavioral analysis
* **Decision Simulator**: Behavioral adjustment projections



## Data & Privacy

All data is stored locally via **browser localStorage**.

* No accounts
* No tracking
* No external APIs required
* Fully deletable
