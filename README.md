Clarity Compass
A Cognitive Intelligence System for Adaptive Self-Optimization

Clarity Compass is a living cognitive intelligence platform that observes behavioral signals, models cognitive load, predicts instability, and evolves alongside the user’s mental rhythm.

It is not a productivity tracker.
It is a cognitive modeling engine.

Core Concept

Your cognitive state is dynamic.
Clarity Compass translates daily behavioral inputs into:

Load trajectories

Stability probabilities

Burnout risk forecasts

Behavioral archetype detection

Growth evolution tracking

It transforms subjective mental states into measurable cognitive intelligence.

Tech Stack

React 18 + TypeScript

Vite

Tailwind CSS

shadcn/ui

Recharts

Spline (ambient 3D rendering)

Optional local LLM integration (Ollama)

Key Systems

Cognitive Arc
Daily system state → reflective question → adaptive resolution

Load & Stability Modeling
Real-time cognitive load computation with recovery deficit analysis

Risk Forecasting
Probabilistic modeling of:

Burnout risk

Instability likelihood

Cognitive depletion curves

Cognitive DNA

Reactivity Index

Sleep Sensitivity

Cognitive Age

Volatility Profile

Archetype Detection
Behavioral signature clustering to identify dominant cognitive patterns

Simulation Lab
